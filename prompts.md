# PROMPTS.md

## Prompt 1
Create a simple SplashScreen in lib/screens/splash_screen.dart.

## Prompt 2
Read REQUIREMENTS.md and implement Step 2.1 only.

Follow all AI Assistant Guardrails in REQUIREMENTS.md.

Implement the core data models for the app in the /models directory:
- Project
- LaborEntry
- MaterialEntry

Requirements:
- Create one file per model in lib/models
- Keep these as pure Dart data classes only
- Include constructors
- Include copyWith methods if appropriate
- Include Firestore-friendly serialization helpers (toMap/fromMap)
- Support optional fields where indicated in REQUIREMENTS.md
- Use DateTime in the Dart models and serialize appropriately for Firestore
- Do not implement services, providers, screens, or widgets yet
- Do not modify unrelated files
- Do not jump ahead to future steps

## Prompt 3
Read REQUIREMENTS.md and implement only the first part of Step 2.2.

Follow all AI Assistant Guardrails in REQUIREMENTS.md.

Task:
Create lib/services/database_service.dart and implement only the project-related cloud persistence methods for now.

Requirements:
- Keep the service UI-free
- Use Cloud Firestore
- Use streams for live updates
- Assume projects are stored under:
  users/{uid}/projects/{projectId}
- The service should support:
  1. createProject(Project project)
  2. streamProjectsForCurrentUser()
- Use FirebaseAuth to determine the current authenticated user
- Return typed Project objects, not raw maps
- Do not implement labor entry or material entry methods yet
- Do not implement providers or screens yet
- Do not modify unrelated files

After making changes, summarize:
1. Which files were created or modified
2. What was implemented
3. Any assumptions made
4. Any follow-up steps required
